# Discord screenshot bot
A Discord bot made in Python that will take screenshots of your desktop on a command.

# Note
This bot will only work if you are hosting it on a computer. It won't work if you are hosting it on a webserver of some sort.

# How to setup
Setting it up is pretty simple. Just replace "TOKEN" with your bot token and put your bot.py in a separate folder, inside that folder you need to make another folder just named "screenshots" like this.
